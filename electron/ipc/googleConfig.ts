 *   1. APIs & Services → enable the **Google Drive API**.
 *   2. OAuth consent screen → External → add your users as **Test users**. Keep it in Testing;
 *      see the note on scopes below for why publishing is not a casual step.
 *   3. Credentials → Create OAuth client ID → Application type: **Desktop app**.
 *      A "Web application" client will not work: this app signs in through the system browser
 *      with a loopback redirect (RFC 8252), which web clients do not permit.
 *   4. Paste the client ID below, and put the secret in `.env.local` (see below).
 *
 * The client ID is a PUBLIC identifier and is safe to commit.

/**
 * Scopes.
 *
 * `drive.file` alone would be the least-privilege choice — it grants access only to files this
 * app itself creates — and it is what the sibling Canvas Extractor Tools app uses. It is not
 * enough here: this app has an in-app Drive browser that lists and searches the user's existing
 * documents so they can pick a rubric to convert, and `drive.file` cannot see a file the app did
 * not create.
 *
 * `drive.readonly` is one of Google's **restricted** scopes. The consequences are worth stating
 * plainly, because they are not obvious:
 *   - While the consent screen stays in **Testing** with an explicit test-user allowlist, this is
 *     fine and needs no review.
 *   - **Publishing** the consent screen with a restricted scope requires an annual third-party
 *     security assessment, which is expensive. Do not publish this app casually.
 *   - Testing mode expires refresh tokens after **7 days**, so users re-authorise about weekly.
 *     That is a real annoyance, and it is why every document the app produces can also be saved
 *     locally without signing in at all.
