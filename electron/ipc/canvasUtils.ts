 * down. So "4 to >3 pts" is simply 4 — and a rubric exported from Canvas round-trips back into it
 * unchanged.
 *
 * What it refuses is a cell with no maximum in it at all: ">90" and "<70" name one edge of an
 * open band, "N/A" and "varies" name nothing. These used to become 0.
 *
 * That silent zero is the reason this function exists. `parseFloat(x) || 0` reads ">90" as NaN and
 * hands back 0, so a criterion worth ninety points deployed to Canvas worth none — with no error,
 * because Canvas is perfectly willing to accept a zero. Nobody finds that until a student's grade
 * is wrong. A rejection the user can see and act on is strictly better than a number that is
 * quietly incorrect, so this returns null and the caller refuses the whole CSV.
