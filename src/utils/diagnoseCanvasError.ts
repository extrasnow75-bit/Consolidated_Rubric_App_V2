/**
 * Turn a Canvas failure into a cause and a next step.
 *
 * Every deploy failure used to surface as one red line holding whatever text came back — some of
 * it ours, some of it Canvas's, none of it saying what to do. "No Canvas course is saved yet"
 * names a real cause but not the screen that fixes it; "Invalid access token" is Canvas's wording
 * for an expired token and reads like an accusation; a 500 is not the user's problem at all.
 *
 * This maps them. It is deliberately a pure function over the message text: the same strings are
 * produced in the main process, so they can be matched here without another IPC round trip, and
 * a pure function is one the tests can cover exhaustively — which matters, because every branch
 * here is a claim about what the user should go and do.
 *
 * Matching is on substrings rather than exact equality on purpose. Our own messages are stable,
 * but Canvas's come from its API and vary by version and instance, so the rules look for the
 * distinguishing phrase and fall back to something honest when nothing matches.
