/**
 * A two-or-three-way choice, styled like the rest of the app.
 *
 * It replaces the native `<input type="radio">` groups, which were the only OS-drawn controls
 * left in the interface. That is why the settings panels read as a web form dropped into a
 * desktop app: a native radio is a small grey circle the operating system draws to its own
 * conventions, sitting among cards with 16px corners and black uppercase labels. Nothing else on
 * screen looks like it, and on Windows it does not even look like the same control as on a Mac.
 *
 * The radios are still here, one per option — kept, not faked. They carry keyboard and screen
 * reader behaviour that is tedious and easy to get wrong by hand: arrow keys move within the
 * group and skip past it on Tab, and the group is announced as a set with a position in it. They
 * are hidden visually with `sr-only` and drive the appearance of the label beside them through
 * `peer-checked`, so what the user sees is ours and what assistive technology hears is the
 * platform's.
 *
 * `useId` namespaces the `name` attribute, because two of these on one screen sharing a name
 * would behave as a single group — selecting in one would clear the other.
